            When I first applied for GSoC, I found it hard to understand the

          <h3>What is GSoC (Google Summer of Code)?</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on
            bringing new contributors into open source software development.
            GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+
            week programming project under the guidance of mentors. (From the
            official

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Massive Learning Curve:</b> During the pre-GSoC and GSoC
              period, you will be able to learn to code like a professional!
              You'll level up your Git/GitHub skills, learn to collaborate
              remotely, manage a complex project, and communicate like a pro!
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Stipend:</b> The programme offers stipends to the selected
              contributors during the program duration.

                <li>
                  be eighteen (18) years of age or older upon registration for

                </li>
                <li>
                  for the duration of the Program, be eligible to work in the
                  country in which they reside;
                </li>
                <li>
                  not be an Organization Administrator or Mentor in the Program;

                </li>
                <li>
                  be a student or a beginner to open source software
                  development.

            </li>
          </ul>
          Let's take a pause and look at the important periods in the timeline.
          <ol>
            <li>
              The mentoring organizations will be announced on February 19. But,
              considering that the organizations more or less stay the same from
              year to year, it's a good idea to look at last year's
              organizations to get an idea of who might participate this year.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the organizations and the projects are announced, you should
              start going through the project ideas. Some of the organization
              typically have a competency test to shortlist candidates, be
              careful to read the instructions carefully as it depends on the
              organization. For omegaUp, I had to appear for a coding test
              before I could submit my proposal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Apart from that, you should also start going through the codebase.
              It's a good time to raise a few meaningful PRs as they will serve
              as a very good proof of work while writing your proposal. Don't
              hesitate to reach out to the mentors if you have any doubts
              regarding the implementation. In general, you should use public
              channels (like the organization's IRC/Discord/Slack channels) to
              ask your questions if not specified otherwise by the organization.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can submit your proposals on the official GSoC site from March
              16 to March 31. Remember, you can submit up to three proposals,
              which can be for different organizations or the same one.
            </li>
            <li>
              After submitting your proposals, it's important to stay engaged
              with the community and be responsive to any feedback or questions
              from mentors. If you are actively contributing, you should
              continue doing that. Some of the organizations may also reach out
              to you for further discussions or interviews. I had to appear for
              an interview with omegaUp mentors before getting selected.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, all you have to do is wait for the results! If you have made
              it this far, congratulations! If not, don't lose hope, you may
              continue contributing and reapply next year. This way, you will be
              in a much better position next time.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <hr />
          <h3>Writing a Proposal:</h3>
          The proposal is the most important part of your application. A well
          written proposal can make a huge difference in your chances of being
          selected. A few things to keep in mind while writing your proposal
          are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Do not use LLM to write your proposal.</b> Write it in your own
              words. It should reflect your understanding of the project and
              your approach to solving the problems the project presents. You
              can definitely use LLM to fix grammar and spelling mistakes and
              improve the readability of your proposal. But, make sure to review
              the final output.
            </li>
            <li>
              In general, the organizations provide a proposal template and
              impose certain guidelines. If available, try to follow them
              closely.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's a good idea to include code blocks to illustrate your points.
              Besides, you can use flowcharts or diagrams to represent complex
              ideas visually. I prefer
              <a
                href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages"
                target="_blank"

                >Lucidchart</a
              >
              for creating diagrams.
            </li>
            <li>
              Highlight your relevant skills and experience. Provide links to
              your previous work, contributions, or portfolio. If you have
              already contributed to the organization, make sure to mention that
              as well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Please plan your timeline carefully. Break down the tasks and

          a good proposal example from previous year's omegaUp project "AI
          Teaching Assistant" (submitted by Nandini).
          <br />
          Here're few repositories with a lot of proposals from previous years:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a
                href="https://github.com/Aritra8438/GSoC_archive"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >GSoC_archive</a
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <a
                href="https://github.com/SammanSarkar/GSoC_archive_2025"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >GSoC_archive_2025</a
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <hr />
          <h3>A peek into the selection process:</h3>
          Once you submit your proposal, the organization admins and mentors
          will have to review it and rank it based on some metric depending on
          their requirements. They might ask you for further clarifications or
          an interview. So, if the organization gets 100 proposals, they can
          choose to rank all of them or shortlist a few and rank only those.
          Ideally, if there are multiple proposals with the same project, the
          organization will rank only one for obvious reasons. Once the ranking
          is done, the organization will submit the rankings to Google. Now, it
          completely depends on the GSoC team to decide how many slots an
          organization gets. If they choose 4, then the first 4 proposals in the
          shortlist will be selected.

              If you are a complete beginner to open source and git (or version
              control system, in general), you should definitely learn git (and
              GitHub) first. Git is an essential tool for open source
              development enabling you raising PRs and reviewing code.
              <br />

              You may also want to take a look at previous years' organizations
              and their projects and get an idea about the tech stacks they
              used. You can head over to the following links to find the list of
              organizations from previous years:
              <ul>

              While choosing an organization/project, it's completely fine if
              you don't know all the tech stacks used. You can always learn the
              rest and ask for help when needed. Sometimes, you might feel like
              the codebase is too complex to understand. You don't have to
              understand everything right away; focus on the parts relevant to
              your project/contributions. Once you get familiar with how things
              work, you'll soon get enough confidence and grip over the codebase
              to explore more.

              In my experience — and while this can vary by organization —
              submitting a few <b>meaningful</b> PRs might be a huge help. Think
              of those PRs as your 'proof of work' showing that you understand
              the codebase well!
