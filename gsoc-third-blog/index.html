            Hey everyone, I'm Aritra, a senior pursuing my B.E. degree in
            Electrical Engineering at Jadavpur University. This summer, I am
            working on adding more summarization functions to the Mathesar UI as
            a part of GSoC 2023. I have written two more blogs (In case you have
            missed them, here is the
            <a href="..#blogs">link</a> to the collection). In this blog, I will
            share how we implemented the
            <strong>Peak Time Aggregation</strong> function using
            <strong>Modular average.</strong>

          <h3>What is Modular Average?</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            Let's re-explore high school physics. <br />
            What is the centre of mass? It is the weighted (according to their
            masses) average position of all the parts of the system. So, if we
            take an infinitely long massless line and place some masses (say,
            m1, m2,..., mn) on it at distances (r1, r2,..., rn), then the mass
            of the system will be (m1+m2+...+mn), and the centre of mass will
            lie at r, which will be given by,
          </p>
          <div class="center" style="width: 37%">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <img

            />
          </div>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            Now, let's solve a slightly different problem. <br />
            <strong>
              In place of a line, we now have a massless disc of unit radius,
              and unit masses (m1= m2=...=mn=1) are placed on the border of the
              disc at some angles (θ1, θ2,..., θn). At what angle will the disc
              topple?
            </strong>
            <br />
            The problem will be more general if the particles have masses of m1,
            m2,..., mn and a distance of r1, r2,..., rn from the centre (i.e.,
            all of them are not placed on the border). The approach will be very
            similar, but a little more complex and not required for the
            explanation of the aggregation function. <br /><br />
            So, let's solve this:
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/modular_avg_1.png" alt="mod_avg_1" />
          <img src="assets/img/modular_avg_2.png" alt="mod_avg_2" />

          <img src="assets/img/modular_avg_4.png" alt="mod_avg_4" />
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            Phew, that was a lot of calculations. Let's understand how it's
            related to <strong>Modular average</strong> and
            <strong>Peak Time Aggregation.</strong> <br />
            For modular variables, the main difference is that the values are no
            longer linear. Modular variables with modulo n take values in the
            range of 0 to n-1, and 0 and n-1 aren't at the furthest from each
            other; rather, they are adjacent to each other. If we add 1 to n-1,
            we will land at 0, and subtracting 1 from 0 will result in n-1.
            <br />
            So, if we try to find the mean of 0 and n-1, we would expect it to
            be midway between 0 and n-1, so what's the middle point? We know 0
            and n-1 are adjacent, and therefore the pair has a distance of 1
            between them. So, it will be at n - 1/2, which has a distance of 1/2
            from both points. Practical Example? Circle. When we complete one
            rotation around a circle (i.e., 360°), we again land at 0°.
            Similarly, we expect the mean of 300° and 0° (or 360°) to be 330°
            (not 150°).
            <br />
            <strong>How is it related to peak time aggregation?</strong><br />
            Time is a very popular modular variable (to be specific, the year is
            not, but all the smaller units of time are indeed modular). So,
            similar math will apply when we intend to calculate the mean (or
            peak) time. The only thing is that we have to consider time in
            24-hour format (not the conventional 12-hour format).<br />
            <strong>Singularity:</strong><br />
            So, what will be the case when the points are at equal distance? Say
            three points are placed on the border of the massless disc at 0°,
            120°, and 360°. If we follow the mathematical approach, we would get
            r_eq = 0 (we would expect the COM of the system to be at the centre
            of the disc). So, the mean angle will be null. <br />
            So, singularity will arise when COM is at the centre (or r_eq = 0).

          <h3>Implementing PostgreSQL Custom Aggregation Function:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            Once the mathematics were done, we started to implement the
            PostgreSQL function to calculate peak times. It was my first time
            writing a custom Postgres aggregate. So, I learned a lot. <br />
            <strong>How does Postgres aggregate work?</strong> <br />
            <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xaggr.html">
              Postgres documentation</a
            >
            on user-defined aggregates will be the best place for you to learn
            the same. I would briefly discuss things. <br />
            A custom aggregate takes a column and iterates over each element of
            the column by keeping track of the state variable. State variables
            are initialised to a certain value, and the state transition
            function is used to update the state variable every time an element
            is iterated. <br />So,
            <strong
              >state_var = state_transition_function (state_var,
              element)</strong
            >
            for every element of the column. The final function is used to
            calculate the final value of the aggregation from the state
            variable. If you want to go through the implementation details, you
            might want to go through my PR mentioned below. I tried my best to
            make the variables' and functions' names self-explanatory. If you
            have any doubts, please reach out to me.
