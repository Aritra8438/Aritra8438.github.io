            Hey everyone, I'm Aritra, a senior pursuing Master's degree in
            Computer Science from Chennai Mathematical Institute. I have
            completed my B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Jadavpur
            University. I'm passionate about math, physics, and computer
            science, and I'm currently diving deep into cryptography, bitcoin,
            and complexity theory. I have done GSoC twice with

            is a global, online summer internship program focused on introducing
            university students to bitcoin open-source development and design. I
            will briefly explain the selection process of SoB.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              First, you need to apply for the programme

            </li>
            <li>
              Note that, there are two tracks, <strong>Developer</strong> and
              <strong>Design</strong>. You need to select one of them. I
              selected the <strong>Developer</strong> track.
            </li>
            <li>
              After applying, you will be notified about the selection process
              and the timeline. You'll also receive a few study materials.

              will require you to dive deeper into the bitcoin world. Along with
              the course contents, I would suggest you to go through the

              You need to successfully complete all 4 challenges to get selected

            <li>
              Once the proposal round kicks off, you will get a list of the

              <ul>
                <li>
                  You should go through all the projects and select a few that
                  matches your tech stack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You should also join the public communication channels of the
                  organizations and start discussing the projects with the
                  mentors and the competitors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Next, if possible, go through the codebase and try to
                  understand the relevant part of the codebase.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After this, you should start writing the proposal. If the
                  mentors allow, get it reviewed by them before the final
                  submission.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Soon after the proposal round, you'll get to know the verdict of
              the proposal.
            </li>
          </ol>
          IMO, Summer of Bitcoin is really hard to get into. In 2025, around
          5000 students applied and maybe 70 of them got selected. That means it
          has a selection rate of only 1.4%, which apparently makes it more
          competitive than GSoC.<br />

          <h3>My Introduction to Braidpool:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            While going through the projects, I found a few that matched my tech
            stack. <strong>Committed Mempool </strong> of the organization
            <strong>Braidpool </strong>was one of them. Apart from that, the
            codebase was written in Rust, Python (and would need CPP), which I
            was familiar with.
            <br />
            So, first I will introduce Braidpool.

              >Braidpool</a
            >
            is a scalable peer to peer bitcoin mining pool with support for
            hashrate futures. If you want to know more about it, you can check
            out the

            <br />
            Braidpool's discord channel is super active. Once joined, Bob (the
            maintainer and the mentor) was very helpful and supportive
            explaining the project. He guided me through the codebase and helped
            me understand the relevant parts. I even went through a few papers
            to understand how
            <strong>Braidpool</strong> would work and how
            <strong>BlockDAG</strong> is an improvement over traditional
            <strong>Blockchain</strong>. I also had a few discussions with the
            community members to gain more insights.
            <br />
            Soon, we started contributing to the codebase. I started with a few
            small issues and then moved on to the Braidpool V1 implementation.
            It was a great experience and I have already learned a lot about the
            bitcoin world. You can access my proposal

          <h3>Braidpool V1 + Committed Mempool:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            The project aims to introduce a decentralized mining pool
            (Braidpool) which is based on BlockDAG, not the traditional
            BlockChain. The project also focuses on introducing a committed
            mempool to accommodate the higher frequency beads (weak blocks)
            submission.
            <br />
            A share is a "weak block" that is defined as a standard bitcoin
            block that does not meet bitcoin's target difficulty, but does meet
            some lesser difficulty target. <br />
            The share is itself a bearer proof that approximately w=1/x sha256
            computations have been done. The share data structure has additional
            data that indicates to other miners that the share belongs to
            Braidpool, and if it had met bitcoin's difficulty target, it
            contains commitments such that all other miners in the pool would be
            paid according to the share tally. A Bead looks like the following
            structure:

              The <strong>Committed Mempool</strong> is a second mempool within
              bitcoind that contains only transactions committed within
              Braidpool shares (beads).
            </li>
            <li>
              A <strong>bead</strong> (or share) is a "weak block"‚Äîa standard
              bitcoin block that does not meet bitcoin's target difficulty, but
              does meet a lesser difficulty target.
            </li>
            <li>
              Beads are created much more frequently than bitcoin blocks, which
              would require transmitting a full bitcoin block (about 4MB)
              several times per second to all nodes‚Äîcreating huge bandwidth and
              processing overhead.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong>Committed Mempool</strong> solves this by making the
              block template independently computable, so only a few kilobytes
              of data need to be transmitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              On average, a bitcoin block has about
              <strong>3810 transactions</strong>. If the bead difficulty is set
              to 1/1000th of bitcoin's, there will be 1000 beads per bitcoin
              block, so each bead should add about
              <strong>5 transactions</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              At any time, the committed mempool holds all transactions that
              have been added to at least one bead but are not yet in the
              bitcoin blockchain.
            </li>
            <li>
              To get all transactions for a bead, a deterministic algorithm
              (<strong>getBlockTemplate</strong>) runs on the committed mempool,
              producing a set of valid, non-conflicting transactions. The bead
              then adds its chosen ~5 transactions to this set and calculates
              the merkle root.
            </li>
            <li>
              Because the algorithm is deterministic, the bead only needs to
              include the transactions it chose itself, not all transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using the committed mempool, the block size is reduced to a few
              kilobytes, making transmission across the network much more
              efficient.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, this requires an additional algorithm that will take a
              light-weight bead and convert it to a bitcoin block.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Thanksgiving:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            All of these wouldn't be possible without the support of my parents,
            friends and teachers. I'm thankful to them.
            <br />
            I am immensely grateful to Nandini for supporting me throughout.
            <br />I would like to thank Bob for his excellent mentoring. It was
            way easier to dive deeper with all his help and support. Lastly, I
            would like to thank all the co-contributors Ansh, Calisto, Abdullah,
            Mohd, Abhishek, Priya, David and Keshav. With them, it was always
            fun to discuss and brainstorm ideas.
            <br />
