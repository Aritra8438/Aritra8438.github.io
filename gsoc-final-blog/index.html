          <h3>Project Synopsis:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            The aim of my project was to add more aggregation functions to the
            Mathesar UI, which will let users easily aggregate data based on a
            grouping column. Here is a list of different aggregation functions
            that we have added to the UI. (Click on the images to visit the
            issues)

            </a>
            <br />
            Apart from them, I have worked on fixing some regression bugs
            related to the summarization.

            Here are explanations of some of the summarization functions we
            added: <br />

                  >Support for sum aggregation function while summarizing
                  columns:</a
                >
                <br />
                In this PR, I have added the sum summarization function. Well,
                what does that mean?
                <a
                  href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64671908/241967422-62e6e419-6731-457f-974e-df6b33ced3eb.mp4"

                >
                is a video that explains how it works. In short, If you have a
                grouping column and a column you want to aggregate (or calculate
                the sum of), then this summarization function will result in a
                table containing the groups and their sums. Let's assume, We
                have a table which has columns: player's name, Year, Goals
                scored in that year. Now, we want to calculate how many goals
                each player scored throughout his journey. It's easy now, right?
                Just add players as grouping columns and goals as summarization
                columns.

                  >Add median aggregation function:</a
                >
                <br />
                In this PR, I have added the median summarization functions. How
                is median defined? If you give an ordered array, median is the
                middle element of the array after sorting.

                  >Add Peak Time aggregation function:</a
                >
                <br />
                In this PR, I have added the peak time summarization functions.
                Now, what is peak time? - Modular average of time? How is this
                different from the average? Well, time is cyclic and if two
                events happen at 11:59 pm and 12:01 am, you would not expect the
                average time to be 12:00 pm, right? Rather 12:00 am is a good
                candidate.

                is a blog that explains the modular average.

          <h3>Again a thanksgiving:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            While working on this project, I have learnt a lot. With Brent and
            Sean's guidance, nothing felt too challenging. Thanks to Dom,
            Mukesh, Pavish, Rajat, Ghislaine, Anish and my co-interns Maria,
            Varsha and Anshuman for helping me in the project and answering all
            my doubts. Lastly, a special thanks to Kriti for managing this
            wonderful organization.
            <br />All the meetings with Brent and Sean, they were super helpful
            to me, I have gained in-depth knowledge of Git, Django and Postgres.
            Those community events, where we played different multiplayer games,
            I will miss them for sure. <br />
