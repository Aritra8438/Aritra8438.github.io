          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            The main aim of the project was to create the problem creator page

          <h3>The Problem Statement and the Solution tab:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            The problem statement and solution tab allows users to write the
            problem statement and the solution respectively. The markdown
            written in those pages will appear in the problem's statement and
            the solution.
            <br />
            The problem statement uses the <b>Pagedown</b> editor and on saving
            (clicking on th save button) directly updates the store. Here is the
            video demo of the feature. Click on it to go to the pull request.

          <h3>The Problem Code tab:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            The problem code tab allows users to upload the intended solution
            code for the problem. While it doesn't have any direct applications
            now, we might add some features like auto-calculating outputs from
            the inputs on the test-cases tab. The tab supports uploading file
            and then infer the language based on extension. Besides, user may
            select the language and then write the code in the
            <b>Codemirror</b> editor. <br />

          <h3>The Test cases tab:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            The test-cases tab is the main and the most complex part of the
            problem creator. It has multiple features including grouping cases
            and using case layouts. Grouping is a way of organizing test cases
            into different categories. While creating a problem, <b>easy</b> and
            <b>hard</b> might be two common groups.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Sidebar:</b> The sidebar allows user to centrally control all
              the test cases and the groups. User can view, edit, delete and
              download groups and cases from the sidebar.

            <li>
              <b>Case edit tab:</b> This tab allows you to edit a case i.e.
              adding or modifying lines and add case output. A case consists of
              lines which might be a single line, multiline, array and matrix.
              Arrays and matrices gives users a nice abstraction over lines and
              multiline by allowing users to decide sizes, ranges and uniqueness
              of array/matrix elements.

              <b>Layout bar:</b> Layout is a useful tool to save the formats of
              the test cases. Once saved, users can enforce this layout to
              multiple test cases. Layout bar allows users to modify, rename,
              copy and delete layouts.

          There are many other important features that are added to the test

          meta issue to find out more.

          <h3>The zip file creation:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            Currently, the only way to add a problem to the omegaUp server is to
            create a zip file. So, after users are done with the problem
            creation, they can download the zip file to upload the problem to
            the omegaUp server. Also, users can further modify the problem by
            re-uploading the zip file to the problem creator page.

            <li>
              <b>Downloading the zip file:</b> To upload a problem (written from
              scratch) in omegaUp, one should follow the following

          <h3>Cypress tests:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            After adding necessary features, it was important to make sure that
            the problem creator page is robust and works the same way as user
            wants. To make sure, we have implemented some e2e tests using
            <b>cypress</b> along with jest tests written using
            <b>Vue test utils (VTU)</b>.
          </p>
          <h3>Remaining tasks:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            Though the problem creator page is up, we need to test it
            extensively to find bugs and shortcomings. The next phase of the
            project (which will be done after GSoC period) will have some
            interesting features.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Get rid of the Intermediate Zip file:</b> Currently, there's no
              connection between the problem creator page (frontend) and the
              backend-database. Our main focus will be to allow users to
              directly create the problems without downloading and re-uploading
              zip file. Not only it will remove the zip file, it will also help
              users modify the draft problem directly which will be stored in
              the database.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Auto-calculate outputs:</b> Currently, while writing the test
              cases, we need to calculate outputs before we write down the
              outputs. Alternatively, we can get the test cases output from the
              omegaUp server by running the code written in the code tab and
              auto populate the outputs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What I have learnt:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            A lot, literally a lottt! Vue, typescript, cypress, PHP, bootstrap,
            vue test utils, vuex store and the list goes on. I had a very little
            idea about most of those before, this period of 5 months turned out
            to be extremely enriching for me. Not only these languages and
            frameworks, but I also had to dive deeper for the design of the
            problem creator page which helped me a lot as a developer.
