            I love Mathematics and Algorithms. My favorite subject is Complexity
            theory. Besides, I spend my leisure time playing football, watching
            soccer matches, enjoying anime and reading manga. I also (less
            frequently) contribute to the open-source repositories.

          <h3>Pre-GSoC period:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            When I planned on applying for GSoC this year, it was already a bit
            late. While browsing through the organizations, I selected some of
            them (that aligned with my interest) like OmegaUp, Keploy and Oppia
            to start contributing. After going through the selection criteria of
            OmegaUp, I was a bit amazed as it required the candidates to attend
            a programming contest first. An applicant needed to solve 2 out of 3
            problems to be eligible for further rounds.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Round 1: Solve 2 out of 3 in a

              >
              :3
            </li>
            <li>Round 2: A Merged PR.</li>
            <li>Round 3: Writing a (good) proposal.</li>
            <li>Round 4: Interview, yay!</li>
          </ul>
          Transparent and crisp selection procedure, isn't it? I liked it too.
          <br /><br />

          <h3>My Introduction to OmegaUp:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            My first introduction to OmegaUp was through the
            <a
              href="https://discord.gg/PAw4Pgejcv"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >official discord server</a
            >
            of OmegaUp. The channels were (are) super-active and
            contributor-friendly. From the very beginning (setting up OmegaUp
            dev env) to the selection process, the admins and the candidates
            helped me a lot.
            <br />
            The contest was pretty interesting. I initially managed to solve two
            questions (1st and 3rd), though out of interest, I solved the 2nd
            one later. After clearing the first round, I started trying to
            contribute to the codebase. There were many good first issues to
            start with and maintainers were super helpful in assigning us the
            perfect one. After 3 of my PRs were merged, I started writing
            proposal. Once I have written a draft proposal, I've submitted it to
            the mentors for review to get their feedback. After some days of
            waiting, I received an email requiring me to schedule an interview.
            Carlos and Juan took my interview (which lasted for 45 minutes) and
            asked me some non-technical and 2 technical (development-related)
            questions.
            <br />
            One more thing, PRs not only make you eligible for selection but
            also give you a greater understanding of the codebase, which will
            help you later anyway. So my suggestion will be to work on solving
            as many issues as possible.

          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            So, what is OmegaUp?

            OmegaUp had 5-6 projects related to the online judge of OmegaUp.
            Among those, I chose the

            is the proposal that I submitted and will use throughout the
            project.
            <br />
            One of the main components of the OmegaUp platform is the
            competitive programming online judge. An online judge has 3 main
            components: problem, code and the verdict of the code on that
            problem. Currently, to create a problem on OmegaUp, we have to rely
            on the zip file that can be created through the expertise of the
            problem creators (which makes it difficult for the new users ) or
            via the unofficial CDP. The Github repo that deployed the site is
            public and now a Public Archive. So, it can’t be an official tool
            for OmegaUp. Moreover,
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If a user finds a bug on the website, as it’s a public archive,
              it’s not possible to make a pull request.
            </li>
            <li>No newer feature can be added to the website.</li>
            <li>
              The fate of the site largely depends on the author's availability.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            Currently, after a problem is created, if we need to modify the
            same, we need to again upload the zip file to the CDP, modify it and
            upload the modified zip file on the problem-edit page on OmegaUp.
            <br />
            Enabling users to directly generate a problem (without generating
            the intermediate zip file) may help a lot of users and make the edit
            problem action much easier and intuitive.
            <br />
            So, the motivation behind this project is migrating the whole CDP to
            the OmegaUp website. This project aims to make the OmegaUp problem
            creation easier, more intuitive and more versatile as well as
            backwards-compatible.

          <h3>Thanksgiving:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13pt; justify-content: space-evenly">
            All of these wouldn't be possible without the support of my parents,
            friends and teachers. Thanks to Nandini for never letting me lose my
            hope. I'm thankful to them.
            <br />
            I am immensely grateful to Juan for such good mentoring. With every
            comment and suggestion of him in my PRs, I have learnt a lot. He
            assigned me some of the issues which gave me an in-depth
            understanding of the codebase.
            <br />
            Carlos was super helpful during my interview. There were a lot of
            bad things that happened in the interview (my VSCode got uninstalled
            at the very beginning) and Carlos supported me throughout. With
            every question, he mentioned the answer he was expecting.
            <br />
            I would also like to thank Hugo and Vanessa for reviewing and
            merging my PRs. Lastly, I would like to thank all the mentors and
            applicants (specifically Ahmed and Kartik) of the OmegaUp
            organization for their constant support.
